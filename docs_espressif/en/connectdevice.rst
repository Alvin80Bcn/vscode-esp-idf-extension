In Visual Studio Code, go to ``View`` > ``Command Palette``, enter ``ESP-IDF: Select Port to Use``, and choose the serial port that your device is connected.

If you are not sure about the serial port name, refer to `Establish Serial Communication <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html>`_.

Next, proceed to :ref:`Configure your project <configure_your_project>`.
